# Clear the field

## Project description
This is my version of the classic game minesweeper. You start with a field that you know is filled with mines. Your job is to make the field a safer place by placing flags on all the positions where a mine is hidden. You have a tool with you 
that checks one square of your choosing in the field and gives you information on how many mines is surrounding 
the square you checked. The problem is that the tool will make any mine explode if it's used on a square that hides a mine. Be 
careful!

## How to install
1. Click the "Download ZIP" button and unzip the file
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the **code** directory inside the unzipped directory clear-the-field
3. Compile the game by typing: ```javac Game.java```
4. Start the game by typing: ```java Game```

## Testing strategy
I will work using a test driven development, this forces me to write tests before I write any additional code. It 
will also, most likely, lessen the amount of bugs.
